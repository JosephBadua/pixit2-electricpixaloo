# Pixit

Pixit was made at HackSC during their annual hackathon at 2020. With the sustainability vertical in mind, Pixit was designed to create a spark of action as well as bring local awareness to the cleanliness of the community. 

## Getting Started and the Basics
Using Google Map's Geolocation API, Pixit is able to have users landmark places in their community, which is shared amongst all users; letting them know some places have been cleaned and that some placed need volunteers to clean help clean out the rest. 

## Overview and Features
Our data is stored through MongoDB Atlas, which is used numerous times through the application, such as on page load when we display all the latitudes and longitudes on the map where users have registered places as clean. Users are able to register for an account and keep track of their progress on the go with an iOS application where they can report on their progress as they go out and clean their community!
